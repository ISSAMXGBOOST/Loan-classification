# LoanClassification
In this repository, you will find some classification model to predict whether a loan will be paid off or not.  
Therfore, we will use 4 algortihms to build this models:  
    - K-Nearest Neighbors  
    - Decision tree  
    - Support Vector Machine  
    - Logistic Regression  
Then, we will compare these 4 models by comparing their accuracy, using these metrics:  
    - Jaccard Index  
    - F1-score  
    - LogLoss (for the Logistic Regression model)
